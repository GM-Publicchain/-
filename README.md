The blockchain technology is used to lay a high-performance R&D framework, with distributed applications to help practical chain products, and to create a global infrastructure with a global landscape. GM, open a new era of blockchain application! Blockchain Genesis Since the completion of the creation block in 2009, the blockchain has reached its tenth year. During this period, we witnessed how it changed from a niche technical concept to a venture capital called the “fourth technological revolution”. The new product in the context of this economic crisis is affecting in an unstoppable way. The life of each of us. Essentially, a blockchain is a concatenated transaction record (called a block) that is concatenated and protected by cryptography. Each block contains the cryptographic hash of the previous block, corresponding time. Stamps and transaction data (usually represented by the hash value calculated by the Merkel tree algorithm), such a design makes the block content difficult to tamper with. The blockchain combines distributed networking technology, asymmetric cryptography, and smart contracts to build a peer-to-peer value transmission network without third parties. Blockchain has many inherent characteristics. Based on the above architecture, we can abstract as follows: 1. Decentralization: Blockchain uses distributed accounting and storage, and there is no centralized hardware or management organization. The system is jointly maintained by nodes that maintain functions; 2. Openness: In addition to the fact that the private information of the parties to the transaction is encrypted, the data is open to everyone, and anyone can query the blockchain data and develop related applications through the public interface. The entire system information is highly transparent; 3. It cannot be modified: once the information is verified and added to the blockchain, it will be permanently stored in the distributed node, and the modification of the database on a single node will be invalidated in the confirmation; 4. Anonymity : Since the exchange between nodes follows a fixed algorithm, the data interaction does not need to be trusted, so the counterparty does not need to establish trust through public identity, and can achieve anonymity through asymmetric encryption; 5. De-trusting: blockchain adoption is based on Consensus specifications and protocols enable all nodes in the entire system to exchange data freely and securely in a trusted environment Reduce the cost of trust. Due to the above characteristics, with the continuous strengthening of the consensus model, people gradually began to use blockchain technology and industries other than electronic cash, such as finance, medical, entertainment, education and other industries that are closely related to life, also ushered in the blockchain. In the entrepreneurial tide, we call this type of project a “blockchain+” model. “Blockchain+” integrates the existing industry model with the blockchain concept to integrate the characteristics of distributed storage and smart contracts into the business logic of the industry, so that the deep-rooted problems of efficiency, monopoly and security can be solved and brought to the industry. Essential change. The bottleneck in the development of blockchain However, things have not progressed in full accordance with the subjective will of human beings. The current blockchain technology and its application are facing great challenges. In the coming 2018, tens of thousands of blockchain projects around the world were born, but no killer application came out and never really changed any industry. On the other hand, encrypted digital currency, which is co-produced with the blockchain, has become the target of most speculators. With the increasingly obvious drawbacks, the blockchain industry has entered a rather embarrassing situation, which is manifested in the following aspects: 1. Blockchain application dilemma 2017-2018, with a large number of public chain main online lines, blockchain application DAPP Become a new hot area. Take EOS as an example. In November alone, the number of DAPPs on the main network reached 174, and the number of active users exceeded 730,000. However, from the perspective of function, these DAPPs are mainly based on financial games and wool, which have little practical use. This is also a common problem in the DAPP field of the entire blockchain. The blockchain industry has now fallen into application difficulties. 2. Encrypting Digital Asset Bubbles In a strict sense, encrypted digital certificates (Tokens) are one of the main derivatives of blockchains and are also evidence of circulation of values ​​on the chain. However, most of the public's understanding and attention to the blockchain is now from the secondary market of digital assets, not the technical application or the blockchain itself. The most direct impact of this situation is that once the secondary market has huge price fluctuations, Impact on the entire ecology. 3. Lack of Blockchain Governance Rules Governance has been a major problem for all blockchain projects, and it is difficult to bypass the community users themselves regardless of the consensus mechanism. On the other hand, the vitality and persistence of a public chain are also based on governance. At present, most public-sector community construction is not perfect. Users generally do not have the foundation of decentralized community management. It is difficult to undertake the public chain after the early team withdrawal. Governance Responsibility, in other words, without community governance, can't achieve true “decentralization” and long-term smooth operation. 4. Blockchain Compliance Issues Blockchains are international and cross-border, while the real world has national boundaries. Countries have different policies and regulatory measures for blockchains and digital assets. Therefore, the development of the blockchain must be in compliance with the implementation of ecological construction in line with local policies and laws. Under the current circumstances, on the one hand, some regional policies have not yet been finalized. On the other hand, blockchain project parties often have insufficient understanding of compliance, resulting in the blockchain industry moving away from the policy. Faced with these above-mentioned industry problems, the blockchain urgently needs a change that touches the essence. We will gradually strip away the slick blockchain myth and establish a blockchain ecological platform for application and service for people's livelihood-GM. We will focus on every detail of the food, clothing and housing, and provide the development of blockchain technology to serve the public and serve the public. We will base on the blockchain 3.0, fully utilize the community construction management and DAPP application areas to build a compliance, autonomy, Practical GM ecology.

GM (Dare) is a blockchain application ecosystem platform based on blockchain 3.0, which consists of GM public chain, DAPP support framework, distributed cloud service, and user autonomous community. GM is committed to building a decentralized, trusted, global infrastructure platform that combines blockchain and cloud computing technologies. GM will implement a new solution aimed at applying blockchain technology to basic services. We will create a developer- and user-friendly and scalable technical support framework that uses cross-industry application clusters as a skeleton. Encrypting the certificate into the blood, laying an open sharing ecosystem that serves the global users across industries and regions. At the technical level, GM aims to connect, integrate and apply a variety of computing-capable resources (such as large and medium-sized computer rooms, PCs and mobile devices) through blockchain and cloud technologies, and convert them into digital asset values ​​using the DOPS consensus mechanism. Through the developer-friendly strategy, DAPP empowers the blockchain application entrepreneurs to jointly establish and manage a complete DAPP product system. At the application level, GM, as the blockchain infrastructure ecosystem, has a number of business development modules that can implement data-level, advanced versions of assets including operational levels through decentralized, distributed value networks and non-peer encryption technologies. Application ecosystems such as management, user community autonomy, and open smart contracts can provide system-level support for decentralized asset issuance, management, custody, clearing, auditing, process control, and dispute arbitration, providing global humans with A comprehensive, easy-to-use, safe and stable chain lifestyle.

GM technical architecture is a brief introduction to improve the application status of blockchain in essence, improve the efficiency of cross-industry operation and bring better user experience. GM adopts DPOS consensus model and six-layer classic structure on the technical level. It provides a richer application extension module to mine community technology energy in a developer-friendly form and achieve blockchain application integration and coverage at a lower cost. 1. Consensus mechanism Consensus is one of the most important aspects of the blockchain concept. Which consensus model is used to determine the operation mode of the entire blockchain maintenance, such as block packing rules and decentralization depth. As a public chain focusing on applications, GM adopts a highly efficient DPOS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus model. The community users holding the GM system vote to elect 21 super nodes to complete the blockchain. Maintenance, transaction confirmation, etc., to ensure eco-efficiency, security and user experience with efficient TPS. 2. The essence of the data uplink blockchain is a distributed ledger. The block itself is a value storage means. However, due to the decentralization characteristics and current technical conditions, the chain is only suitable for lightweight data storage. Non-large file winding. So decide which data is on the chain, how the data is chained, and how to deal with large files such as video and games and invalid redundant data becomes a key issue in each application chain. For such problems, GM uses a form of trusted data validation and indexing. For lightweight data, we will ensure the security of valid data after performing trusted third-party digital signature verification; for large data, we will store it in distributed servers through an open distributed solution like IPFS. At the same time, the source data is indexed by hash encryption, and the two correspond to each other through the hash pointer. After the index is chained, the source data is stored outside the distributed chain to ensure the efficiency of the public chain. 3. Trusted interaction on the chain We know that data interaction is the key link in the decentralized ecology. Users initiate transactions, participate in voting, and use DAPP all involve the data interaction process on the chain. At the same time, user assets will also be distributed in the form of data throughout the network, and the reliable interaction of information is especially important for maintaining the overall ecological stability. In GM, we adopt a more general asymmetric encryption technology to achieve security problems in data transmission and prevent information leakage. As one of the three technical cornerstones of blockchain, asymmetric encryption uses the recipient's public key for encryption and provides its own private key signature during data transmission. Only the recipient with the private key has the decryption authority. During the entire interaction process, the user's public and private keys are isolated, and any third party cannot decrypt it through technical means, providing users with information security protection on the chain. 4. Developer Support In order to facilitate the GM global application ecological construction, we will maximize the developer-friendly mechanism. While the public chain source code is open, we will also provide a complete API and related developer documentation, and the cross-industry application framework will be used. Developer portal for full process support for third-party DAPP development. We will provide smart contract IDE tools based on the GM public chain, enabling any independent developer to easily deploy smart contracts in the application to develop, publish and operate DAPP. At the same time, we will also provide Token distribution support, and any developer can release the encryption pass based on GM public chain ecology on the GM platform.

GM layered network structure (top-down) GM adopts the common process structure of the public chain, but in some details, it is adjusted according to the application ecological characteristics, from top to bottom: application layer, contract layer, incentive Layer, consensus layer, network layer, and data layer. 1. Application layer The same as the application layer positioning in the classic mode, the application layer in the GM system mainly provides functional interfaces for various application software, and provides client-side package related tools. On this basis, we have also added cross-chain application components to enable efficient communication and data interaction between the chains. 2. The contract layer mainly includes GM built-in contract, GM virtual machine, in which the contract support engine part (ie GM virtual machine) is a virtual machine that provides Turing complete computing capability, and can support high-level language contract development such as C++ and Java. Make various GM-based chain-based data operations correctly and automatically. 3. Incentive layer In the blockchain ecology, the main role of this layer is to ensure the overall stability of the public chain. As a DPOS consensus model project, GM will implement key aspects of ecological management through the incentive layer. We will use a part of the Token to lock the warehouse through the smart contract, and the batch production block will encourage the GM main chain to run smoothly. 4. Consensus layer The essence of the consensus layer is to provide consistency rules for DAPP on the public chain, in other words, a state confirmation mechanism that must be formed by applications running on each node in the decentralized network. For GM, it is through DPOS to achieve long-term stable management of chain applications. We will set up 21 peer-to-peer super nodes as block producers to ensure the validity and security of consensus. 5. Network layer The network layer is one of the necessary structures of any form of blockchain. The purpose is to realize the link and communication of the blockchain network to ensure the smooth operation of the main chain and applications running on it. The GM network layer is a distributed peer-to-peer network composed of all nodes., each of which uses peer-to-peer (P2P)
Ways to connect with each other constitute the basis of the GM consensus mechanism and the entire ecology.
6. Data layer
As the bottom layer of the blockchain classic model, the data layer describes the structural basis of the blockchain - the district
Blockchain organization. GM has added a digital identity model based on this, that is, we will
Each GM user provides the lowest level digital ID of the blockchain, and the user's digital identity will be associated with the GM public chain.
Deep binding.
In the development of the blockchain industry, especially after the birth of the "blockchain+" model, one
The criteria for judging a project often lie in whether it can change the production relationship of the original industry and reflect the blockchain.
The value of this industry.
For the GM project with the blockchain foundation ecology as the main criterion for measuring success or failure
To be expressed in the following three aspects:
1. Can you complete the technology of blockchain from industry application to basic ecological application?
Transformation
2. Can promote the construction of blockchain compliance and make effective progress;
3. Can it reflect the value change of developers and users under the blockchain ecology?
Blockchain basic ecological transformation
At the moment, the development of the blockchain industry is in a period of major transformation, with the expanding market area.
The blockchain industry presents some problems: on the one hand, there are significant restrictions on the public chain of specific industries.
Closed, can not effectively achieve cross-chain collaboration services; on the other hand, the same industry projects are redundant,
Problems such as user shunting and lack of practicality.
We believe that the blockchain industry has entered the stage of qualitative change from industry application to basic ecology.
Only through the construction of an open and basic ecological platform can we effectively solve the application dilemma in the blockchain field. at me
In our definition, GM is not only a public blockchain, but also an open blockchain ecosystem.

The blockchain project realizes technological breakthroughs and jointly contributes to the development of blockchain.
Blockchain Compliance Exploration
In the past 2018, tens of thousands of blockchain projects and industry-related applications have emerged around the world.
Most of these projects are still on the verge of national regulatory policies. Especially in the secondary market of digital assets
At the moment of the overall downturn, violations and running of the road have occurred from time to time, and social problems and legal questions that follow
The problem has seriously hindered the development and popularization of blockchain technology and applications.
We believe that achieving compliance construction is the only way to develop the next stage of the blockchain industry. 2018
In October, the National Internet Information Office issued the “Regulations on the Management of Blockchain Information Services (Request for Comments)
Draft), released the signal of "strong supervision, re-conformity", legislation in the field of blockchain, the era of law
Kicked off. Since its inception, GM has been adhering to a service-oriented, down-to-earth spirit, and unswervingly traversing.
Policy, embrace the regulatory blockchain development path.
In the fourth quarter of 2018, the GM project team established the company's main body in the Hainan Free Trade Zone in response to national policies.
And rooted in Hainan, it has established a project headquarters integrating blockchain research, Internet research and development, and product operation.
Concentrate on the exploration of the application system of blockchain technology in the field of people's livelihood, and the compliance of blockchain
Sexuality and practicality contribute to the society and give back to society with technology.
GM will implement the Hainan Free Trade Zone's "advanced international advanced rules and continue to deepen reform and exploration"
The overall goal of development is to develop the blockchain technology and cross-industry applications according to local conditions, accurately landing, according to law
Construction. At the same time of compliance development, GM Ecology will bring politics, culture, technology and travel to Hainan.
Make ecological contributions to the development of tourism, taxation, etc., and effectively improve local people's livelihood and let more people
Enjoy the convenience brought by the development of blockchain.
Retarget users and developers
In the current Internet economy model, developers are the source of production for the entire system, while users
Is a consumer at the terminal, and due to the middle-level monopoly formed by large enterprises and channel developers, developers
And the interests of users are often difficult to share the economic development dividend.
In the traditional mode, computing and development resources are mainly attributed to large enterprises, organizations, and information sharing.
Unbalanced resource allocation, imbalance between different systems, and even information barriers
The productivity and benefits of individual developers; similarly, in the traditional form, users as end consumers
It is impossible to understand and participate in ecological construction, and it is impossible to participate in decision-making through effective channels to safeguard its own interests. in
In the GM ecosystem, we will rely on the basic application characteristics of the blockchain to reposition the two values.
For independent developers, after the GM ecological development has a certain scale, they will replace the early
The project team became the main perfection of the GM DAPP system and was motivated by the developer Token.
Due to the openness of the GM public chain and application framework, all developers can use the blockchain browser and

Rely on the openness of GM's ecology and the efficiency of consensus to ensure the effective satisfaction of user asset service needs.
2. Life service
As far as the moment is concerned, the field of life services is still a blind spot in the application of blockchain, although in this
Some of the projects in the blockchain entrepreneurship in the year have been involved, but due to the nature of the industry, most of them are
Stuck in the development or testing phase, the only part of the landing project is also limited by the relatively rough application function
A perfect paradigm has not yet been formed, and it is impossible to put a lot of use and service users.
Since its inception, GM has been oriented to the people's livelihood, paying attention to the people's rice, oil, salt, food, clothing and housing. With

The combination of DAPP running in the state, the application of blockchain in the field of life services will gradually break away from information
The island is truly integrated into the “credit society” under the blockchain 3.0.
3. Intellectual property protection
In recent years, the public’s awareness of the protection of “intellectual property rights” has gradually increased, and due to the volume of information,
The various types of infringements that exist in the network are still banned, making it difficult for quality content creators to obtain
Effective protection. Because the blockchain is time-stamped, open, and non-destructible, it can be easily
The completion of property rights traceability and confirmation can play a decisive role in intellectual property protection.
Compared with other projects, GM's advantage in the field of intellectual property protection is that it is simple and easy to use.
What are the technical operations and complex processes. GM users can immediately know the production letter through the platform DAPP at the end of the creation.
One-click winding for complete protection, simple operation can be formed by anyone at any time but
Unable to modify the data on the chain. According to current laws and regulations, copyright information on blockchains is legally effective.
Force, GM's simplification of the knowledge-based chain can effectively expand the scope of user intellectual property protection, so that everyone can become
For the creator.
4. Game entertainment application
Games are a typical form of blockchain application, and games can usually be compared to other industries.
Enough to get more users, especially young people. From the birth of the ether cat, the blockchain game era is positive
The coming, but what comes with it is the simplification of the game form and the congestion of the blockchain network.
The current blockchain game is more like an investment than an essential entertainment product.
In order to return the game to its essence, GM focuses on the entertainment attributes of game products. In the type of game, I
Our basic ecological platform provides a wide range of games and pan-entertainment modules for DAPP developers.
Support various types of multi-person online blockchain game application development; and in terms of game asset protection, GM is a game
DAPP provides smart contract templates, and the various assets in the game (such as equipment, materials, fashion) are all through the district.
Blockchain technology ensures that all types of gameplay rules are fulfilled by smart contract guarantees, and players can participate in the game.
Get a better gaming experience and rewards.
5. Social applications
Socialization is the urgent need of most human beings, and it is also a milestone in the development of modern mobile Internet.
However, traditional social software has some shortcomings such as information authenticity and user privacy. with
There are also many shortcomings in the blockchain social applications in the current market, such as the use of functional modules.
Poor user experience, poor performance and narrow audiences.
The social application of the GM ecosystem allows users to make more reliable letters by saving them in the data chain.
Interacting with each other, enriching the privilege setting system in social interaction. At the same time, GM decentralized socialization will also regulate social
App content and ad formats to help users avoid low quality content and malicious ads while
The right to review content is given to the community, enabling high-quality eco-contributors to gain platform revenue share. and
In terms of functions, GM relies on efficient TPS and targeted module settings to run social DAPPs.
To provide technical level assurance, build a real and easy-to-use blockchain social network for all users.
6. Civil dispute assistance
Civil disputes are a complex and long-standing topic, such as premarital marital property
Disputes such as appraisal, estate division, property leases, etc. are often difficult to re-establish and retain valid evidence, etc.
The reason has become "difficulty." Although the characteristics of the blockchain technology are used to solve the above problems
In the theoretical feasibility, due to regional cultural differences, user popularization costs and other factors, such problems are
Blockchain applications are rarely involved, and applications with related functions are a blind spot.
As a basic application platform that serves the people's livelihood, GM is correcting the settlement of civil property.
The confusing problems are unique. We add more easy to use based on the original characteristics of the blockchain.
Contract module, users can upload various types of protocol information anytime and anywhere after installing relevant DAPP, and can add
User private key signature, information authentication, face recognition and other auxiliary functions. After a simple authentication operation,
This information is faithfully recorded on the blockchain and can be stored permanently and privately.
Can only be unlocked and viewed by the personal characteristics of the participants, they will be made during mediation or litigation
To assist civil dispute resolution for effective basis.

区块链创世纪
自2009年中本聪完成创世区块以来，区块链已经到了第十个年头。这期间，
我们见证了它如何从一个小众的技术概念，转变成为被称作“第四次科技革
命”的创业风口，这个经济危机背景下的新生产物正在以一种无法阻挡的方
式影响着我们每一个人的生活。
本质上讲，区块链是指是借由密码学串接并保护内容的串连交易记录(称
为区块，block)，每一个区块包含了前一个区块的加密哈希、相应时间戳记以
及交易数据(通常用默克尔树算法计算的哈希值表示)，这样的设计使得区块内
容难以篡改。区块链融合了分布式组网技术、非对称加密技术、智能合约，旨
在构建一个不借助第三方的点对点价值传输网络。
区块链有着与生俱来的诸多特性，基于上述架构，我们可以抽象为如
下几点：
1.去中心化：区块链使用分布式核算和存储，不存在中心化的硬件或
管理机构，系统由维护功能的节点来共同维护；
2.公开性：除了交易各方的私有信息被加密外的数据对所有人公开，
任何人都可以通过公开接口查询区块链数据和开发相关应用，因此整个系
统信息高度透明；
3.不可篡改性：一旦信息经过验证并添加至区块链，就会永久存储于
分布式节点，单个节点上对数据库的修改将在确认中无效化；
4.匿名性：由于节点之间的交换遵循固定的算法，其数据交互是无需
信任的，因此交易对手无须通过公开身份建立信任，并可通过非对称加密
实现匿名；
5.去信任化：区块链采用基于共识的规范和协议使得整个系统中的所
有节点能够在去信任的环境自由安全的交换数据，降低信任成本。
由于上述特性，随着共识模型的不断强化，人们渐渐的开始将区块链
技术应用与电子现金以外的领域，如金融、医疗、娱乐、教育等与生活息
息相关的行业也纷纷迎来区块链创业潮，我们将这类项目称为“区块链+”
模式。“区块链+”通过将已有的行业模型结合区块链概念，将分布式存
储、智能合约等特性深度融入行业业务逻辑，使根深蒂固的效率、垄断、
安全等问题迎刃而解，为行业带来本质上的变革。
区块链发展瓶颈
然而，事情并没有完全按照人类的主观意愿而顺利进展，当前区块链
技术及其落地应用面临极大的挑战。在即将过去的2018年度，全球有数以
万计的区块链项目诞生，但却未有一款杀手级应用问世，也从未真正的改
变任何一个行业。而另一方面，作为与区块链共生产物的加密数字货币却
成了大部分投机者追捧的对象。随着日益凸显的弊端，区块链行业进入一
个相当尴尬的境地，具体表现在以下方面：
1.区块链应用困境
2017-2018年度，随着大量公有链主网上线，区块链应用DAPP成了一个新
的热门领域。以EOS为例，仅11月主网DAPP数量新增便达到174个，活跃用户超
过73万地址。然而从作用角度，这些DAPP以金融游戏、薅羊毛为主，鲜有实际
用途，这也是整个区块链DAPP领域的通病，区块链行业目前已陷入应用困境。
2.加密数字资产泡沫
严格意义上，加密数字通证(Token)是区块链的主要衍生产物之一，也是
链上价值流通凭证。然而目前公众对区块链的认识和关注大部分却来自数字资
产二级市场，而非技术应用或区块链本身，这种情况的最直接影响便是，一旦
二级市场出现巨大价格波动会对整个生态产生冲击。
3.区块链治理规则缺失
治理一直困扰着所有区块链项目的一大问题，无论何种共识机制都难以绕
开社群用户本身。另一方面，一条公链的生命力和持久性也基于治理，目前大
多数公链社群建设并不完善，用户普遍不具备去中心化社群管理基础，难以在
早期团队退出后承接起公链治理责任，换言之，没有社群治理就无法实现真正
的“去中心化”和长期平稳运行。
4.区块链合规性问题
区块链是国际性的，跨国界的，而现实世界则存在着国家界限，各国对区
块链和数字资产有着不同的政策和监管措施。因此区块链的发展必须具备合规
性，在符合当地政策法律基础上推行生态建设。而目前情况下，一方面部分地
区政策尚未定型，另一方面区块链项目方往往对合规化认识不足，导致区块链
行业游走于政策边缘。
面对以上这些行业问题，区块链急需一场触及本质的变革，我们将逐渐剥
离华而不实的区块链神话，建立一个面向应用、服务民生的区块链生态平台—
—GM。我们将着眼衣食住行的每一个细节，将区块链技术发展服务于实体、服
务于公众，我们将立足区块链3.0，充分发挥社群建设管理和DAPP应用领域拓
展，构建一个合规、自治、实用的GM生态。

GM(敢吗)是一个基于区块链3.0的，由GM公有链、DAPP支持框架、分
布式云服务、用户自治社群构成的区块链应用生态平台。GM致力于打造一
个去中心化的、可信任的、结合区块链与云计算技术的、全球化的基础设
施平台。
GM将实现一种新的解决方案，旨在将区块链技术广泛应用于基础服务
领域，我们将打造一个对开发者和用户友好的可拓展技术支持框架，以跨
行业应用集群为骨骼，以加密通证为血液，铺设一个跨行业、跨地区，服
务于全球用户的开放式共享生态。
在技术层面，GM旨在通过区块链及云技术连接、整合和应用各种具备
计算能力的资源(如大中型机房、PC和移动设备)，并采用DOPS共识机制将
其转换为数字资产价值，通过开发者友好策略，让DAPP赋能区块链应用创
业者，共同建立和管理一个完善的DAPP产品体系。
在应用层面，作为区块链基础生态平台的GM拥有众多业务拓展模块，
可通过去中心化、分布式价值网络及非对等加密技术实现包括可操作级别
的数据上链、进阶版本的资产管理、用户社群自治、开放的智能合约等应
用生态体系，能够对去中心化的资产发行、管理、托管、清结算、审计以
及流程管控、争议仲裁等提供系统级别的支持，为全球人类提供一个功能
全面、便捷易用、安全稳定的链上生活方式。

GM技术架构简述
为从本质上改善区块链应用现状，提升跨行业运转效率并为用户带来更好
的使用体验，GM在技术层面采用DPOS共识模型和六层经典结构，并在此基础上
提供更丰富的应用扩展模块，以开发者友好形式挖掘社区技术能量，用较低的
成本实现区块链应用整合与覆盖。
1.共识机制
共识是区块链理念中最为重要的环节之一，采用何种共识模型几乎决定了
整个区块链维护的运行方式，如区块打包规则、去中心化深度等。GM作为一个
关注应用的公有链，采取了效率较高的DPOS(Delegated Proof of Stake，委托
权益证明)共识模型，由持有GM体系通证的社区用户投票选出21一个超级节点
完成区块链维护、交易确认等，以高效的TPS保障生态效率、安全和用户体验
。
2.数据上链
区块链的本质是一个分布式账本，区块本身是一种价值存储手段，然而
由于去中心化特点和当前技术条件限制，链上仅仅适用于轻量级数据存储，
而非大型文件上链。于是决定哪些数据上链，数据以何种方式上链，如何处
理如视频、游戏等大文件和无效冗余数据成为了每个应用链条的关键问题。
针对此类问题，GM采用了可信数据验证和索引形式。对于轻量级数据，
我们将在进行可信第三方数字签名验证后上链存储保障有效数据的安全性；
而对于大型数据，我们将通过类似IPFS的公开分布式方案存储于分布式服
务器中，同时通过哈希加密方式将源数据生成索引，二者通过哈希指针互
相对应，在索引上链后源数据通过分布式链外存储，以保障公链效率。
3.链上可信交互
我们知道，在去中心化生态中数据交互是关键环节，用户发起交易、
参与投票、使用DAPP都涉及链上数据交互过程。同时，用户资产也将以数据
形式在全网流通，实现信息的可靠交互对维系整个生态稳定尤为重要。
在GM中，我们采取较为通用的非对称加密技术实现数据传输中的安全
问题，防止信息泄露。作为区块链三大技术基石之一，非对称加密在数据
传输过程中，发送方使用接收方公钥进行加密并提供自身私钥签名，而只
有持私钥的接受用户具备解密权限。整个交互过程中用户公私钥隔离，任
何第三方无法通过技术手段解密，为用户提供链上信息交互安全保障。
4.开发者支持
为方便GM全局应用生态建设，我们将最大程度实现开发者友好机制，在公
链源码公开的同时，我们也将提供完善的API及相关开发者文档，将跨行业应用
框架作为开发者门户，实现对第三方DAPP开发的全流程支持。
我们将提供基于GM公链的智能合约IDE工具，使任何独立开发者可在应用中
便捷的部署智能合约，实现对DAPP的研发、发布和运营。同时我们还将提供
Token发行支持，任何开发者都可在GM平台发布基于GM公链生态的加密通证。

GM分层网络结构（自顶向下）
GM采用了公有链通用的流程结构，但在部分细节设计上根据应用生态特性
做了相应调整，自顶向下分为：应用层、合约层、激励层、共识层、网络层和
数据层。
1.应用层
与经典模式中的应用层定位相同，GM体系中的应用层主要面向各类应用软
件提供功能接口，并提供客户端封装相关工具。在此基础上，我们还添加了跨
链应用组件，可实现链间有效通讯和数据交互。
2.合约层
主要包括GM内置合约、GM虚拟机，其中合约支持引擎部分(即GM虚拟
机)，它是一个提供图灵完备计算能力的虚拟机，可支持C++、Java等高级
语言合约开发，使各种基于GM公链的数据操作可正确的自动完成。
3.激励层
区块链生态中，本层主要作用在于保障公链整体稳定。作为一个DPOS
共识模型的项目，GM将通过激励层实现生态管理的关键环节。我们将一部
分
Token通过智能合约锁仓，分批激励区块生产节点维护GM主链平稳运行。
4.共识层
共识层的本质是为公链上的DAPP提供一致性规则，换言之是在去中心
化网络中的各个节点运行的应用所必须形成的状态确认机制。对于GM而言
，
就是通过DPOS实现对链上应用的长期稳定管理方式，我们将设立21个权限
对等的超级节点作为区块生产者，保障共识的有效性和安全性。
5.网络层
网络层是任何形式区块链的必备结构之一，目的实现区块链网络的链
接和通信，保障运行在其上的主链及应用顺利运转。GM网络层是一个由全
节点组成的分布式对等网络，其中的每个网络节点都使用点对点(P2P)的
方式连接彼此对等，构成了GM共识机制和整个生态的基础。
6.数据层
作为区块链经典模型最底层，数据层描述了区块链的结构基础——区
块链式组织结构。GM在此基础上加入了数字身份模型，也就是说，我们将
每个GM用户提供区块链最底层的数字身份证明，用户数字身份将与GM公链
深度绑定。
在区块链产业发展过程中，特别是在“区块链+”模式诞生后，一个
项目的评判标准往往在于能否改变了原生行业的生产关系，体现区块链在
这个行业的价值。
对于以区块链基础生态为主旨的GM项目而言，衡量成功与否的标准主
要表现在如下三个方面：
1.能否完成区块链从行业应用到基础生态应用的技术
转型；
2.能否推动区块链合规性建设并取得有效进展；
3.能否体现区块链生态下开发者和用户的价值转变。
区块链基础生态转型
当下，区块链行业发展正处于重大转型期，随着市场的不断扩大区
块链行业呈现出部分问题：一方面，特定行业公链存在极大的限制乃至
封闭，无法有效实现跨链协作服务；另一方面，同行业项目冗余严重，存
在用户分流及实用性不足等问题。
我们认为区块链产业已然进入从行业应用到基础生态的质变阶段，通
过建设开放的基础生态平台才能有效解决区块链领域的应用困境。在我
们的定义中，GM不仅仅是一条公有区块链，更是一个开放的区块链生态
平台。
我们为各行业定制了丰富的框架模型，任何人都可在此基础上进行
DAPP开发和运营，以满足各行业对于分布式管理、数据上链、智能合约、
去信任化及产品溯源的需求，依托区块链3.0打造可编程社会，为每个人
定制涵盖各行业的链上生活方式。

GM还将是一个以开放为宗旨的区块链基础生态，我们将为其它区块链项
目或应用提供多种支持接口并向其开发者开放，通过跨链数据技术实现链网
服务，为用户提供多维度的有效支持。
随着底层技术、共识模型、应用领域的不断拓展和完善，GM将成为一个
全球范围内人人参与、人人共建、人人共享的区块链基础生态平台。我们也
会将GM模式打造为区块链行业应用到基础应用的发展范式，协助更多优质区
块链项目实现技术跃迁，共同助力区块链发展。
区块链合规性探索
在过去的2018年中，全球有数以万计的区块链项目及产业相关应用问世，
而其中大多数项目仍游走于各国监管政策边缘。特别是在数字资产二级市场
整体低迷的当下，违规、跑路现象时有发生，随之而来的社会问题和法律问
题严重阻碍了区块链技术及应用的发展和普及。
我们认为实现合规化建设是区块链行业下阶段发展的必经之路。2018年
10月，国家互联网信息办公室出台了《区块链信息服务管理规定(征求意见
稿)》，释放了“强监管、重合规”的信号，区块链领域立法、依法时代即将
拉开帷幕。GM自创立之初便秉承专注服务、脚踏实地精神，坚定不移的走贯
彻政策、拥抱监管的区块链合规性发展道路。
2018年第四季度，GM项目组响应国家政策在海南自贸区成立公司主体，
并扎根海南建立了集区块链科研、互联网研发、产品运营为一体项目总部，
集中力量探索区块链技术在民生领域的落地应用体系建设，为区块链的合规
性和实用性贡献力量，以技术回馈社会。
GM将贯彻落实海南自贸区“对标国际先进规则，持续深化改革探索”的
发展总目标，将区块链技术的发展及跨行业应用因地制宜，精准落地，依法
建设。在合规发展的同时，GM生态将为海南地区带来政治、文化、技术、旅
游、税收等生态性的发展做出窗口式的贡献，切实改善当地民生，让更多人
享受区块链发展带来的便利。
重新定位用户与开发者
在现行互联网经济模式中，开发者是整个体系的生产源头，而用户则
是位于终端的消费者，而由于大型企业、渠道商形成的中层垄断，开发者
和用户利益往往难以分享经济发展红利。
传统模式下，计算、开发资源主要归属于大型企业、组织，信息共享
能力差资源分配失衡，不同体系之间相对封闭甚至存在信息壁垒严重制约了
个人开发者的生产力和收益；同样的，在传统形式下，用户作为终端消费者
无法了解及参与生态建设，也无法通过有效渠道参与决策维护自身利益。在
GM生态中，我们将依托区块链基础应用特点，为两者价值实现重定位。
对于独立开发者而言，在GM生态发展具备一定规模后，他们将取代早
期项目团队成为GM DAPP体系的主要完善者，并可获得开发者Token激励。
由于GM公有链及应用框架的公开性，所有开发者均可通过区块链浏览器及
开源站点查询并调用相关模块，并用于DAPP开发及发布。此外开发者还可
自主运营DAPP，或许平台应用收益分成，甚至自主发行Token并获取运营
奖励。
对于社区用户而言，在GM生态中可参与分布式计算、社群乃至整个项
目治理。一方面通过基于区块链技术的分布式计算服务平台整合计算能力、
信息数据并实现链上存储，有效挖掘个人设备(包括PC、个人服务器和移动
设备等)闲置计算资源和数据资源，提供用户可获得相应Token奖励。另一方
面GM以去中心化通证为纽带用户与整个生态体系，用户可用获得的Token兑
换GM DAPP各类服务，如电商产品购买、移动支付、游戏增值服务定制等，
也可凭借Token参与社群互动，通过投票参与生态发展决策。
综上所述，GM从根本上对开发者及用户进行了重新定位，深度挖掘二
者生产潜能的基础上，实现双方价值，共享区块链发展红利。
GM应用场景浅析
GM致力于构建区块链基础应用生态服务于全球用户，我们将建立高性
能、多领域的链上功能框架，面向各行业区块链服务搭建一系列完善的基
础应用模块，为跨行业落地应用研发提供坚实的基础。以此为根基，任何
DAPP开发者能够更加简单、便捷的实现基于GM公有链的应用软件，有效实
现生态体系扩充、行业范围拓展和用户服务完善。
由于与生俱来的开放特性，GM基础生态可为诸多社会民生问题提供区
块链技术解决方案，通过DAPP的数据上链和去中心化管理等优势，针对性
的解决传统行业面临的效率、安全及信任难题，建立包括但不限资产管理
服务、移动社交软件、游戏娱乐、知产保护、生活服务等领域的区块链应
用体系：

作为区块链应用较为成熟的领域，金融和资产管理是备受诸多项目青
睐。从技术角度，区块链的引入可通过用户可信数据上链、云存储、非
对等加密等技术突破传统资产管理中的流程复杂、成本高昂、效率低下
等弊端，实现资产管理的去中心化和去信任化。但是，目前大多数区块
链金融、资产管理项目往往不具备可扩展性及普适性框架，无法根据不同
用户需求定制服务，在实际应用中难以发挥优势。
而基于区块链3.0的GM则融入了更为广泛、易用的资产管理模块，针
对性的为保险、股权交易、金融衍生品及移动支付提供去中心化解决方
案。各方开发者可更便捷的调用相关功能模块，为用户量身定制产品，并
依托GM生态开放性和共识的高效性确保用户资产服务需求的有效满足。
2.生活服务
就当下而言，生活服务领域仍然是区块链应用的一个盲点，虽然在本
年度区块链创业潮中部分项目有所涉足，但由于行业本身特性，大多数都
停滞于开发或测试阶段，仅存的部分落地项目也受限于应用功能相对粗糙
尚未形成完善的范式，无法真正的大量投入使用、服务用户。
GM从创立之初就面向民生领域，关注老百姓柴米油盐、衣食住行。随
着GM基础生态建设的不断完善，独立开发者的日益丰富和社群建设的持续
推动，GM生态将拥有更完备的C端市场。GM生态相当于一个完整的应用集
群，而非单一产品，我们将携手广大独立开发者在这个“集群”中加入
更多功能、覆盖更广泛领域的DAPP，例如餐饮外卖、小商品零售、酒店
租房、约车租车、影视娱乐、运动健身等等。在此模式下，GM将完善全体
用户个人信用档案并进行链上存储和去中心化管理，并通过智能合约与生
态中运行的DAPP有机结合，生活服务领域区块链应用将逐渐脱离信息孤
岛，真正融入区块链3.0下的“信用社会”。
3.知产保护
近年来，大众对“知识产权”保护意识逐步提高，而碍于信息体量，
存在于网络中的各类侵权行为仍屡禁不止，导致优质内容原创者难以获得
有效保护。由于区块链具备时间戳、公开性和不可篡改性，能够轻而易举
的完成产权追溯及确认，在知产保护方面可发挥决定性作用。
相对于其他项目，GM在知产保护领域的优势在于简捷化，使用时无需任
何技术操作和复杂流程。GM用户可在创作完结时立即通过平台DAPP将知产信
息一键上链以完成保护，进行简单操作即可形成任何人任何时间都可查阅但
不能修改的链上数据。根据当前法律法规，区块链链上版权信息具备法律效
力，GM对知产上链的简化可有效扩展用户知识产权保护范围，让每个人都成
为创造者。
4.游戏娱乐应用
游戏是区块链应用的一种典型表现形式，与其他行业相比，游戏通常能
够获得更多用户特别是青年人的参与。从以太猫的诞生，区块链游戏时代正
式来临，但与之俱来的却是游戏形式的单一化和区块链网络的拥堵，于是乎
当下的区块链游戏更像是一种投资品，而非本质上的娱乐产品。
为使游戏回归本质，GM侧重于游戏产品的娱乐属性。在游戏类型上，我
们的基础生态平台为广大DAPP开发者提供了丰富的游戏及泛娱乐模块，广泛
支持各类多人在线区块链游戏应用开发；而在游戏资产保护方面，GM为游戏
DAPP提供智能合约模板，游戏中各项资产（如装备、材料、时装）都经由区
块链技术确权，各类玩法规则都由智能合约保障履行，玩家可通过参与游戏
获得更佳的游戏体验和收益奖励。
5.社交应用
社交是绝大多数人类的刚需，同时也是现代移动互联网发展的里程碑，
然而传统社交软件存在着信息真实性、用户隐私安全等方面的不足之处。同
时当前市场上的区块链社交应用则也存在诸多不足，例如功能模块简陋、用
户体验不佳、性能表现较差以及受众范围过窄等。
GM生态的社交应用可通过数据链上保存形式，使用户进行更可信赖的信
息交互，丰富社交中的权限设定体系。同时，GM去中心化社交也将规范社交
应用中的内容及广告形式，协助用户规避低质量内容和恶意广告的同时，将
内容的审核权利赋予社区，使高质量生态贡献提供者获得平台收益分成。而
在功能方面，GM则凭借高效的TPS和针对性的模块设置，为社交类DAPP运行需
求提供技术层面保障，面向全体用户构建一个真实易用的区块链社交网络。
6.民事纠纷援助
民事纠纷是一个复杂而历史悠久的话题，一直以来例如婚前婚内财产
鉴定、遗产分割、财物租借等纠纷往往都由于难以复盘及保留有效证据等
原因成为“疑难杂症”。虽然以区块链技术的诸多特性对解决上述问题存
在理论可行性，而由于地域文化差异、用户普及成本等因素，此类问题在
区块链应用领域也鲜有涉及，具备相关功能的应用更是一个盲区。
GM作为一个以服务民生为己任的基础应用平台，对于解决民事财产纠
纷类问题有着独到之处。我们在区块链原生特性基础上添加了更为易用的
合约模块，用户安装相关DAPP后可随时随地上传各类协议信息，并可添加
用户私钥签名、信息认证、人脸识别等辅助功能。经过简单的认证操作，
这些信息都会被忠实的记录在区块链上，并能够进行永久且私密的储存，
仅能凭借参与人员个人特征解锁和查看，在调解或诉讼过程中，它们将作
为有效依据协助民事纠纷处理。
GM是一个开放的、跨行业的、面向全球的复合型区块链基础生态平台，
旨在完善区块链3.0技术应用体系，从技术、产品、用户三个维度实现世界范

GM token简介
GM加密数字通证(简称GM)目前为敢吗项目发行且唯一的以太坊ERC20通
证，在GM公有链主网上线之后，GM将按照1:1比例兑换为主网通证，并映射至
相应主网地址中。
在GM公链、DAPP、数字资产交易平台及自治社区中，GM将作为生态体系
的唯一价值流通凭证。企业、机构可通过提供计算资源、技术支持获得GM，
并可用以兑换生态内资源和参与超级节点竞选；应用开发者可通过原创或完
善DAPP体系获取GM，用以兑换研发资源；用户可通过参与生态建设、社群活
动、自主推广等方式获得GM，并用以兑换整个生态下的各项服务或在二级市
场交易等等。总而言之，GM通证相当于整个生态中的血液，为所有参与者提
供跨领域流通服务。
GM发行与分配方案
GM发行总量恒定为1,500,000,000枚，以智能合约保障永不增发。为确保GM
生态稳定发展、技术体系完善和社群建设顺利进行，GM将采用如下分配方式：
私募及天使投资人20%(用于项目早期面向投资机构及天使投资人发放，
立即释放30%，剩余部分锁仓六个月，之后逐月释放10%)；
创始团队10%(用于创始团队建设、人员工资发放，分两年解冻，每年释
放50%)；
市场推广10%(用于GM项目线上线下推广，全球路演等，分四年解冻，每
年25%)；
社群建设20%(用于用户社群建设，包括社群用户激励、糖果空投、社群
自主化治理等)；
开发者激励8%(用于GM公链上的DAPP生态，其中50%用于开发者技术支
持，另外50%用于高品质应用奖励金)；
顾问团队2%(用于回报协助GM生态部署的技术、社群、市场领域专家
顾问)；
生态共享基金30%(为逐步建立GM全球生态自治体系，我们将这部分
Token作为共享基金，由超级节点及社群用户共管共享，将跟随生态建设
分四年逐步解冻，按照时序依次为50%、25%、15%及10%)；
税务、法务5%(用于GM项目建设过程中的各项合规性支持、税务及法
务援助)。
GM项目技术团队90%以上均为多年区块链从业者，该团队曾参与多个大型
公链项目设计、运营及管理经验，2018年度荣“获2018引领中国行业经济发
展十大创新人物奖”、“中国区块链技术服务最佳创新奖”等诸多奖项，拥
有成熟的区块链顶层设计及应用管理经验。

加密数字通证风险
2013年中国人民银行、工业和信息化部、中国银行业监督管理委员
会、中国证券监督管理委员会、中国保险监督管理委员会联合印发了《中
国人民银行工业和信息化部中国银行业监督管理委员会中国证券监督
管理委员会中国保险监督管理委员会关于防范比特币风险的通知》(银
发〔2013〕289号，以下简称“《通知》”)。《通知》明确了比特币的性
质，认为比特币不是由货币当局发行，不具有法偿性与强制性等货币属
性，并不是真正意义的货币。从性质上看，比特币是一种特定的虚拟商
品，不具有与货币等同的法律地位，不能且不应作为货币在市场上流通使
用。但是，比特币交易作为一种互联网上的商品买卖行为，普通民众在自
担风险的前提下拥有参与的自由。
同样地，GM不是任何形式的投资和其他国家的法定货币，GM作为一种
虚拟商品，也不属于投资品，它的升值完全靠市场规律和应用落地后的
需求决定；市场决定因素导致价格完全不可控的风险。同时代币在不同
的数字货币交易所的流动性，以及受关注程度不同，也会存在一定的流
通风险。BCT实际作为互联网电子商品支付的虚拟货币，除此之外不做任
何其他应用性保证。
政策风险
区块链相关科技以及交易所等，目前还没有明确的政策监管和审查措
施，相关风险的逐渐显露，未来政府部门出台的监管政策或给未来GM在交易
所相关的交易活动带来较大的不确定性，具有政策风险。GM在世界各国运营
时，将严格尊重遵守该国相关法律及法规。
技术风险
区块链作为一个新生技术，尽管有坚实的密码学基础，但在多个具体领
域仍处于探索和积累经验的阶段，存在着诸多风险，包括技术的独立性、创
新性、技术路线的合理程度，是否能满足市场需求，技术团队的执行能力，
应对黑客或者攻击的能力等领域，都存在着诸多不确定性和风险。
GM的发放模式，公链上线前主要采用通行的以太坊代币形式进行发放，
其间设计以太坊账户、智能合约开发与运行、以太币和GM的转移与登记，均
为互联网上完全公开的数据和代码，存在着受到攻击和破坏的可能，考虑到
以太坊曾经出现The DAO受到攻击导致以太坊硬分叉的历史，而从GM的体量和
所处的历史阶段来看，出现受攻击的情况可能无法通过相关手段来减少用户
的损失，这方面风险需要进行充分考虑。
信用风险
每个区块链项目都需要针对团队成员、背景情况、诚信状况、经营管理
能力、产品设计能力和执行能力等各方面情况综合了解，针对项目的信用风
险做出评估。
